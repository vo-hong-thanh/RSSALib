# RSSALib
The Java-based implementation of the rejection-based stochastic simulation algorithm (RSSA). The software library provides a simulation engine and a GUI. The details of the RSSA algorithm are described in the original paper published in Thanh et al. J. Chem. Phys. 141, 134116 (2014). The library also implements many simulation algorithms including Direct method, Next reaction method, Composition-rejection method, Partial-propensity direct method as well as the approximate tau-leaping algorithm, and support delays.
